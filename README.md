## Spiders

This project contains two spiders and you can list them using the `list`
command:

    $ scrapy list

Both spiders extract the same data from the same website, but `toscrape-css`
employs CSS selectors, while `toscrape-xpath` employs XPath expressions.

You can learn more about the spiders by going through the
[Scrapy Tutorial](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html).


## Running the spiders

You can run a spider using the `scrapy crawl` command, such as:

    $ scrapy crawl toscrape-css

If you want to save the scraped data to a file, you can pass the `-o` option:
    
    $ scrapy crawl toscrape-css -o quotes.json
